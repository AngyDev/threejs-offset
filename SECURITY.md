# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We currently maintain the latest version of the project.  
Older versions may not receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, please **do not open a public GitHub issue**.  

Instead, report it responsibly by:
- Opening a private security advisory via the **"Security" tab** in GitHub, or  
- Contacting the repository owner directly via their GitHub profile.  

We will review the report as soon as possible and keep you updated on progress.

## Best Practices for Contributors
- Do not commit secrets, credentials, or API keys.  
- Use environment variables and GitHub Secrets for sensitive data.  
- Run linting and tests before submitting a PR to help catch issues early.
