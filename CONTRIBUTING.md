# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! 🎉  
Please follow these rules to keep the workflow safe and consistent.

---

## 📌 General Rules
- Do not push directly to `main`.  
- All changes must go through a Pull Request (PR).  
- Keep PRs small and focused.  
- Write clear commit messages (e.g. `fix: correct mesh rendering bug`).  
- Ensure your code passes linting, tests, and type checks.

## 🔀 Fork & Branch Workflow
1. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.  
2. Create a branch in your fork for your changes:
   - `feature/<short-description>` (e.g. `feature/add-login-form`)  
   - `fix/<short-description>` (e.g. `fix/missing-import`)  
   - `docs/<short-description>` (e.g. `docs/update-readme`)  
3. Make your changes in your branch.  
4. Commit with clear messages.  
5. Push to your fork.  
6. Open a Pull Request (PR) against this repository’s `main` branch.

## ✅ Pull Requests
- Make sure your branch is up to date with `main`.  
- Open a PR with a clear title and description.  
- At least one reviewer approval is required (except admins).  
- All CI checks must pass before merging.

---

## 🛠️ Code Style
- Follow the project’s established code style (lint and formatter will enforce this).  
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and components.  
- Keep functions/components small and reusable when possible.

## 📦 Dependencies

- If you add a dependency, explain why in the PR.
